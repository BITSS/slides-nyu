# What does it mean to do good science?

.font140[
Scientific Norms (Merton, 1942, [1973](https://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/merton_sociology_science.pdf)): 

- **Disinterestedness**: search for the truth

- **Organized skepticism**: peer review and replication

- **Communality**: researchers should share all the scientific output (papers, data, code and materials) 

- **Universalism**: validity comes from quality of a scientific finding and not the hierarchies of those making the claims.

# Registrations
<br>
.font130[
- A registration is a record that contains minimal information about a study: title, authors, study country, status, keywords, abstract, start and end dates, outcomes, intervention information, basic research design, whether or not treatments are clustered (when performing an RCT), and Institutional Review Board (IRB) information. 


- Preferably, it should be recorded before analyzing data

- **The main goal:** track the complete body of knowledge in a topic of research, regardless of the direction and magnitude of the results.

|                                PAPs take too much time and are <br>too difficult (Olken 2015)                                |                                                         A PAP changes the timing of the analytic <br>component, not clear that it increases it                                                        |
|                  Scientific discovery often comes<br>from surprises. PAPs stifle <br>discovery (Olken 2015)                  |           PAPs do not prevent researchers from doing <br>exploratory work; they only require <br>researchers to be clear about the objectives <br>of their analyses (Ofosu and Posner 2020).          |
| If replications are cheap they will <br>rule out false positives, making <br>PAPs irrelevant.<br>(Coffman and Niederle 2015) | Very few experiments are inexpensive as to perform <br>many replications. Moreover, most of the false <br>positives have been identified where experiments <br>are least expensive (lab experiments). |

Under discussed:

An under discussed benefit of this principle is that increases access to knowledge for students who are outside of elite schools (no connections or "appropriate politeness" required to obtain materials).

.font120[
- In each of the previous steps there was valuable new knowledge 
- This knowledge is not usually disseminated  
  - End of semester report, or presentation that is not published. 
  - Language across courses is not standard (reproduction? replication?)
  - Current attempts to record this are closer to a full paper format (see [Replication Wiki](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/))
- As a result there is a large amount of missed knowledge.  
   - Each new semester, new students repeat similar excesses and have to reinvent the wheel.  
   - Lost opportunity for building on top of previous exercises. 
   - Lost opportunity for aggregating the new knowledge.

# Beyond Binary Judgments    

Reproductions can easily gravitate towards adversarial exchanges.
  - Early career researcher (ECR) have incentives to emphasize unsuccessful reproductions 
  - Original authors have a more senior position and can use it to deter in-depth reproductions from ECRs. 
  - The media also focuses on eye-catching headlines

### Our approach: 

We do not want to say 
 > "Paper X is (ir)reproducible"    
 
  
--
We do want to say 
 > "Result Y in paper X has a high/low level of reproducibility according to several reproduction attempts. Moreover, improvements have been made to the original reproduction package, increasing its reproducibility to a higher level"

.pull-left[
1. Select or be assigned a candidate paper

2. Check ACRE Platform for previous entries and verify availability of reproduction package (RP)

3. If not RP, leave a short record, and repeat with a different candidate paper 

4. Once RP is found then candidate becomes declared paper 

5. Only then: read the paper and select claim(s), display items and specification to reproduce

# .font70[Identify All the Elements Behind a Display Item]

Reproducers will be asked to draw a clear connection to the raw data sources mentioned in the paper and the display item under reproduction. 
--

### Data sources  
Connect the data sources in the paper's text with specific raw data files. 
--

### Analytic data sets  
Describe each analytic data file. 
--

### Code files  
Inspect all code files and record all their inputs and outputs. 

With all the information recorded above, reproducers can use the **ACRE Diagram Builder** to generate a **reproduction tree**.

# Improvements: Paper-level

.font140[
- Use version control software (Git/Github).
- Improve documentation: comments, indentations, object names, etc.   
- Re-organize the reproduction package into a set of folders and sub-folders that follow [standardized best practices](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications-3-0/#overview-of-the-documentation), and add a master script that executes all the code in order, with no further modifications. [See AEA's reproduction template](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template).  
- Literate programming environment (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, RMarkdown)
- Re-write code using a differenet statistical software (ideally open source, like R, Python, or Julia).
- Set up a computing capsule (e.g., [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/)).

.font120[
- Adding missing raw data: files or meta-data  
  - Example: "Add raw temperature and relative humidity data"
- Adding missing analytic data files
  - Example: "Copy the row files from Data folder into new `Analysis\trade cost\Input`"
- Adding missing analysis or cleaning code
  - Example: "Replaced broken Wald bootstrap code with updated code/command"
- Debugging code  
  - Example:  "was counting each group 4 times in round 1, so fixed that"

Key challenge: constructive exchanges with original authors and other reproducers

# Improvements: future possible 

We ask reproducer to leave concise and actionable tasks for other reproducers in the future. 

Example 1: 
>"Revise the .aml and .bat code scripts to reflect reorganized structure"


Example 2:

**Reasonable specifications** ([Simonsohn et. al., 2018](https://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf)): 

 1. Sensible tests of the research question
 2. Expected to be statistically valid, and 
 3. Not redundant with other specifications in the set.

Reproducers will be able to record two types of contributions: 

- Mapping the universe of robustness checks
- Proposing a specific robustness check

# Promoting a Constructive Exchange 

### For reproducers addressing original authors

#### 1 - Contacting the original author(s) when there is no reproduction package
#### 2 - Contacting the original author(s) to request specific missing items of a reproduction package
#### 3 - Asking for additional guidance when some materials have been shared  
#### 4 - Response when the original author has refused to share due to *undisclosed reasons*   
#### 5 - Response when the original author has refused to share due to legal or ethical restrictions of the data
#### 6 - Contacting the original author to share the results of your reproduction exercise



### For original authors responding to requests from reproducers  

#### 1 - Responding to a repeated request that has been addressed in an earlier interaction  
#### 2 - Acknowledging that the author no longer has access to certain part(s) of the reproduction package  
#### 3 - Acknowledging that some material is still embargoed for future research  
#### 4 - Responding to incomplete/unclear requests
#### 5 - Responding to hostile responses from reproducers

# Possible Mechanism: Opaqueness of Policy Analysis

.font130[
- Incredible Certitudes (Manski, [2011](https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/121/554/F261/5079436))  

- Report wars (Wesselink et al, [2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901112002365))

- Low overall credibility of PA &#8594; credibility based on reputation ("serious") &#8594; assignment of reputation varies across political positions
]
--
.font130[
- Parallels to "Reproducibility Crisis" and Open Science reponse (Hoces de la Guardia, Grant, Miguel [2020](https://academic.oup.com/spp/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scipol/scaa067/6018524?guestAccessKey=ac30d681-5391-4f91-b4d8-44c6aed11161)). Propose:  
  - Core principles for Open Policy Analysis (OPA) in outputs, analysis and materials (reproducibility)
  - Agenda to implement and document how OPA can be applied into several policy issues
 
- Growing adoption of open science methods into policy analysis

# Deworming Interventions   
 - Parasitic worm infections are endemic in many countries, disproportionately affecting the poor  
 - They interfere with regular bodily processes by decreasing nutrient uptake and can thus lead to serious consequences on human health, education outcomes, and long-term economic well being  
 - Mass deworming interventions, at school level, have been propose as a cost-effective approach to tackle this problem

--
 
## Different settings for deworming  
- Context of original study (Kenya, 1998-99) had very high prevalence rates of worm infections
- Implementation costs where very low ($0.42 per round of treatment)
- Length of treatment was relatively short (2.4 years)
- Current deworming settings have lower prevalnce rates, 
varying implementation costs and length of treatments

--

## Strong debate around initial results  
- Ozier ([2020](https://academic.oup.com/wbro/advance-article/doi/10.1093/wbro/lkaa005/6009048)) summarizes differences between original findings (Miguel and Kremer 2004) and a re-analysis (Aiken et al, 2015). Emphazises the role of communication of results in a reanalysis. 
- This type of debate (result/re-analysis) can be seen in several other topics. For example: minimum wage, inmigration, taxation. 
- OPA need not guarante agreement on key research finding, but should help avoid multiple policy reports

  2. Added documentation to increase reproducibility 
  3. Created a public repository with all materials for one-click reproducibility

# Open Output

.pull-left[
## [Demo](https://bitss-opa.shinyapps.io/dw-app/)

<br>
## Main features
- One clear output  
previously agreed in   
consultation with  
policy partner
- Two additional tabs to modify assumptions  
(key assumptions and all assumptions)
- Each source is classified into research,   
data, or guesswork
- High level equations added to illustrate location of components
- Added feature to modify standard deviations
- Track values of each component

# What happens if one principle fails: Opaque Output

.pull-left[
- Policy estimates of approach 2   
of deworming (Baird et al, 2016)
- Assume Open Analysis and   
Open Materials
- Good for researchers 
- Unclear for policy analysts
- Allows policy makers to  
cherry pick results
- Does not disclose uncertainty
- Unclear separation of roles  
between policy analyst and   
policy maker (Truman's request  
for a "one-handed" economist)

# Opaque Analysis/Materials
<br>
.font140[
-  Assume open output and open materials  
-  In this scenario we can have two policy analyses: one from advocates and one from opponents
-  Each analysis can claim to be open source. Code is available, reproducible, and each as an interactive app. 
-  But each analysis can bury in their code analytical choices that move the final policy estimate in their favor
-  Same though exercise can be done with opaque materials

# Lessons for future OPA projects: Timeline
.font110[
1. Reviewed existing documentation  
2. Review code/spreadsheets and write down missing documentation. 
3. Add equations to reflect any additional clarifying steps. 
4. Translate analysis to code scripts (ideally open source software)  
5. Check for computational reproducibility and consult with original analysts for discrepancies/further questions
6. Discuss with policy partner on target policy estimate
7. Draft doodle of app 
8. Incorporate any potential new analysis (repeat steps 1 - 3) 
9. Present draft of OPA (DD and doodle of app) to policy partner
10. Incorporate comments into documentation of the OPA
11. Build app based on analysis of dynamic document 
12. Incorporate any additional features requested by policy partner
13. Verify that all three components produce the same output
14. Publish v1.0

# Useful practices developed during the project

<br>
.font120[
## Documentation of analysis and app are connected
- Each analytic step is declared in the documentation and wrapped in a function
- All this steps are used to produce the results in the documentation
- The steps are also stored in a file that is later sourced in the app. 
- If something changes in the report, it will update the app. 

## Style guide 
- Group objects according to use: only within the documentation, for simulations, and for the app
- Use diagram trees to depict nested relationships

# Lessons for future OPA projects: Costs

- Costs (approx bandwidth over a year at full time): 
 - Principal Investigator 30-50% 
 - Research assistant/programmer 100-150% 
 - Program Manager 20%-30% 
 - Original researcher: 1-5%
 
- Not all policy analysis justify this level of effort
 
- Characteristics that might justify an OPA: 
 - Topics with strong disagreement on the facts among analysts 
 - Recurrent reports (eg. ex-ante economic analysis from development banks/agencies)
 - Topics that have large expected welfare effects (eg. tax reform, social cost of carbon)
 
- With each new OPA project, templates will emerge and costs will likely fall

# Additional Benefits of OPA 

## Easy to update and reuse  
After deworming OPA is released, anybody can modify and improve into a newer version  

## Clearer connection of how evidence from research is used in policy analysis
Researchers can see clearly where their estimates are being used in a policy analysis. For example, the OPA can be used to justify power calculations of potential new studies. 

## Connection with forecasting
When there is little information for a parameter used in an OPA, a forecasting exercise can be carried out to elicit expert knowledge (DellaVigna, Pope, Vivalt [2019](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/428.summary)).
