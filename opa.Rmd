# .font80[Policy Analysis And The Evidence-Based Policy Movement]
.font130[
Evidence-Based movement is growing.  
- The golden age of evidence-based policy (Haskins 2017).  
- Credible causal evidence (Angrist & Pischke, 2010).  
- Transparency and reproducibility of research (Miguel et al. 2014).  
- Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEBP, 2017)  
]
--

.font130[
Policy Analysis is a fundamental link. 
- As many definitions as textbooks (Dunn, 2015; Weimer & Vining, 2017; Williams, 1971)  
- Common denominator: client-oriented empirical analysis meant to inform a specific policy debate  
- Aspires at scientific rigor. (Wildavsky 1979),

# Cherry Picking Evidence
<br>
.font150[
    <blockquote>
    “When I was director of the CBO, I was very frustrated when we would write a policy report [saying] a certain policy would have these two advantages and these two disadvantages, and the advocates would quote only the part about the advantages, and the opponents would quote only the part about the disadvantages. That encourages the view that there are simple answers. There aren’t generally simple answers. There are trade-offs.”

# Deworming Interventions   
 - Parasitic worm infections are endemic in many countries, disproportionately affecting the poor  
 - They interfere with regular bodily processes by decreasing nutrient uptake and can thus lead to serious consequences on human health, education outcomes, and long-term economic well being  
 - Mass deworming interventions, at school level, have been propose as a cost-effective approach to tackle this problem

--
 
## Different settings for deworming  
- Context of original study (Kenya, 1998-99) had very high prevalence rates of worm infections
- Implementation costs where very low ($0.42 per round of treatment)
- Length of treatment was relatively short (2.4 years)
- Current deworming settings have lower prevalnce rates, 
varying implementation costs and length of treatments

--

## Strong debate around initial results  
- Ozier ([2020](https://academic.oup.com/wbro/advance-article/doi/10.1093/wbro/lkaa005/6009048)) summarizes differences between original findings (Miguel and Kremer 2004) and a re-analysis (Aiken et al, 2015). Emphazises the role of communication of results in a reanalysis. 
- This type of debate (result/re-analysis) can be seen in several other topics. For example: minimum wage, inmigration, taxation. 
- OPA need not guarante agreement on key research finding, but should help avoid multiple policy reports

# OPA on Deworming Interventions (Kenya+)

<br>
.font140[
## Contributions of OPA to deworming:  
  1. Selected one policy estimate among several alternatives and establish a clear link between it and underlying assumptions 
  2. Added documentation to increase reproducibility 
  3. Created a public repository with all materials for one-click reproducibility

# Lessons for future OPA projects: Costs

- Costs (approx bandwidth over a year at full time): 
 - Principal Investigator 30-50% 
 - Research assistant/programmer 100-150% 
 - Program Manager 20%-30% 
 - Original researcher: 1-5%
 
- Not all policy analysis justify this level of effort
 
- Characteristics that might justify an OPA: 
 - Topics with strong disagreement on the facts among analysts 
 - Recurrent reports (eg. ex-ante economic analysis from development banks/agencies)
 - Topics that have large expected welfare effects (eg. tax reform, social cost of carbon)
 
- With each new OPA project, templates will emerge and costs will likely fall

# Additional Benefits of OPA 

## Easy to update and reuse  
After deworming OPA is released, anybody can modify and improve into a newer version  

## Clearer connection of how evidence from research is used in policy analysis
Researchers can see clearly where their estimates are being used in a policy analysis. For example, the OPA can be used to justify power calculations of potential new studies. 

## Connection with forecasting
When there is little information for a parameter used in an OPA, a forecasting exercise can be carried out to elicit expert knowledge (DellaVigna, Pope, Vivalt [2019](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/428.summary)).
