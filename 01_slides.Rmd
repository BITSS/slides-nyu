# What does it mean to do good science?

.font140[
Scientific Norms (Merton, 1942, [1973](https://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/merton_sociology_science.pdf)): 

- **Disinterestedness**: search for the truth

- **Organized skepticism**: peer review and replication

- **Communality**: researchers should share all the scientific output (papers, data, code and materials) 

- **Universalism**: validity comes from quality of a scientific finding and not the hierarchies of those making the claims.

# Registrations
<br>
.font130[
- A registration is a record that contains minimal information about a study: title, authors, study country, status, keywords, abstract, start and end dates, outcomes, intervention information, basic research design, whether or not treatments are clustered (when performing an RCT), and Institutional Review Board (IRB) information. 


- Preferably, it should be recorded before analyzing data

- **The main goal:** track the complete body of knowledge in a topic of research, regardless of the direction and magnitude of the results.

# Pre-Analysis Plans
<br>
.font140[
- PAPs are **extensive** methodological descriptions of the analysis to be performed before the endline data is collected

- Helps to prevents p-hacking  

- Only way to guarantee accurate statistical testing

- Distinguishes confirmatory from exploratory analysis

|                                PAPs take too much time and are <br>too difficult (Olken 2015)                                |                                                         A PAP changes the timing of the analytic <br>component, not clear that it increases it                                                        |
|                  Scientific discovery often comes<br>from surprises. PAPs stifle <br>discovery (Olken 2015)                  |           PAPs do not prevent researchers from doing <br>exploratory work; they only require <br>researchers to be clear about the objectives <br>of their analyses (Ofosu and Posner 2020).          |
| If replications are cheap they will <br>rule out false positives, making <br>PAPs irrelevant.<br>(Coffman and Niederle 2015) | Very few experiments are inexpensive as to perform <br>many replications. Moreover, most of the false <br>positives have been identified where experiments <br>are least expensive (lab experiments). |

# Historical Background

.font110[
Economics Before Credibility Revolution (circa 1990, Angrist & Pischke [2010](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.3)):
 - Largely driven by theory with unclear standards of how to judge empirical research
 - Conjecture: opacity in standards made it more difficult for **outsiders** to publish
]
--

.font110[
Economics After Credibility Revolution:  
 - Increase emphasis on well justified (credible) research designs 
 - More transparency on the definition of quality may have open the gates to a more diverse body of researchers 
]
--
.font110[
There are still several steps in the production of knowledge where more transparency can drastically increase scale of scientific production in economics. Examples of questions where opacity still favors elite universities:
  - What defines an area of research as "hot"?
  - What makes a paper publishable (after the analysis is completed)?
  - How does a researcher obtain access to confidential/proprietary data?
]

# .font80[Sample Timeline for the Production of a Scientific Publication]

--
.font120[
- At each of this step, there are some advantages to belonging to the right "club". 
- If we only look at training and publications (what is observable on a CV!) we might attribute a disproportionate role to skill ("genius myth").
]

--
.font120[
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
- Research transparency gives us tools to remove opacity out of every stage in this process. 
- Similar to the credibility revolution, we suspect that lowering this barriers will increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

# Final Thoughts
<br><br><br><br>
.font130[
- Potential unintended consequence: turning some research into burdensom requirements could increase the barriers to entry of less wealthy resource institutions
- Whenever possible, we need to test for:
  - the magnitud of these barriers
  - the effect of implementing research transparency solutions
